                    The labyrinth in this task can be represented as graph.
                    Just think about where you can go from each cell and find the correlating path in the graph.

                    The simplest way is Breadth-First-Search algorithm. But don't mix up graph and tree search.

                    Do you want nice and quick solution?
                    Read about A* search algorithm and don't forget about admissible heuristic.
