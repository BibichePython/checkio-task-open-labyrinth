    <p>Stephen and Sofia wander off for a moment, taking a break from the packing and piling and fixing of things on the
        ship. Randomly, they happen upon an Open Labyrinth they had never seen before on their home island.</p>

    <p>“Look, there’s plenty of adventure to be had right here at home.” exclaimed Stephen. “Are you really sure you
        want to leave?”</p>

    <p>“Nonsense. The real adventure is out there!” She responded while waving to the sky. “But, maybe we can conquer
        this little challenge right here before we lift off into the unknown...”</p>
</div>

<p>The labyrinth has no walls, but pits surround the path on each side. If a player falls into a pit, they lose. The
    labyrinth is presented as a matrix (a list of lists): 1 is a pit and 0 is part of the path. The labyrinth's size is
    12 x 12 and the outer cells are also pits. Players start at cell (1,1). The exit is at cell (10,10). You need to
    find a route through the labyrinth. Players can move in only four directions--South (down [1,0]), North (up [-1,0]),
    East (right [0,1]), West (left [0, -1]). The route is described as a string consisting of different characters:
    "S"=South, "N"=North, "E"=East, and "W"=West.</p>
